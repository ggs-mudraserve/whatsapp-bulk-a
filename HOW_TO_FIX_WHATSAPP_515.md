# WhatsApp Error 515 - Connection Issues

## What Error 515 Means
Error code 515 typically indicates that WhatsApp has temporarily blocked or rate-limited the connection. This can happen due to:

1. **Too many connection attempts** in a short period
2. **Suspicious activity detection** by WhatsApp
3. **Network/IP reputation issues** 
4. **Outdated browser signature** or connection parameters

## Current Fixes Applied

### 1. Improved Connection Parameters
- ✅ Increased timeouts (60s instead of 30s)
- ✅ Added proper retry mechanisms
- ✅ Better browser signature
- ✅ Reduced connection frequency

### 2. Rate Limiting Protection
- ✅ 15-minute cooldown between attempts
- ✅ Automatic auth file cleanup on errors
- ✅ Better error messages for users

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- ✅ Proper 515 error detection and handling
- ✅ Clear user feedback about wait times
- ✅ Automatic session cleanup

## How to Test the Connection

### Step 1: Clear Previous Sessions
If you've been getting 515 errors, wait 15-30 minutes before trying again.

### Step 2: Try Connection
1. Go to WhatsApp page
2. Click "Connect WhatsApp"
3. Wait for QR code to appear
4. Scan with your phone quickly (within 30 seconds)

### Step 3: If Still Getting 515
This usually means you need to wait longer. WhatsApp may have flagged your IP/connection.

**Solutions:**
- Wait 1-2 hours before trying again
- Try from a different network/IP if possible
- Make sure no other WhatsApp Web sessions are active

## Technical Details

### Connection Flow
1. Client connects via WebSocket
2. Server creates Baileys socket with auth state
3. QR code generated and sent to client
4. User scans QR code
5. WhatsApp validates and connects

### Error 515 Triggers
- Multiple failed authentication attempts
- Rapid connection/disconnection cycles
- Network reputation issues
- Too many concurrent sessions

### Prevention
- Always wait between connection attempts
- Clean up auth files after failures
- Use proper connection parameters
- Limit concurrent connections

## Current Status
The app now handles error 515 properly by:
- Showing clear error messages
- Enforcing proper wait times
- Cleaning up auth files automatically
- Providing better user feedback

If you continue getting 515 errors, it's a temporary block by WhatsApp that will resolve with time.
